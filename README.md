# ML_Projects
Detailed explanation is given in the respective ipnyb files

please go through the below description for an overview

Project: Titanic for EDA
Goal: To understand the concepts of EDA on a Titanic data set.
my take aways:
* got an idea of univariant anaylsis
* got an idea of bi variant anaylsis
* understood how to use different plots to get an idea of a feature and its impact on target variable
* identifying outliers using IQR and handling them by either eliminating them or keeing the as is on basis of the feature
* missing value imputation with mean, median or more frequent values


Project: Linear Regression
Goal: To undertand linear regression algoorithm and able to apply it efficiently on petrol comnsumption data of different states.
my take aways:
* got an idea of using pair plot
* got an idea of identifying the linear dependency of features with target variable using pair plot
* understood how to use heatmap to identify colinearity of the variables
* got an idea of fitting a model on to the data
* got an idea of OLS model and its coeficients
* got an idea of different model evaluation metrics like RMS,MAE,MSE and MAPE


Project: K-means
Goal: To understand unsupervised data and clustering technique using Kmeans on credit card user data.
my take aways:
* scaling the data using min max scalar and standard scalar
* fitting a clustering algorithm on the data
* identifying optimum K value using elbow method and silhoutte score
* understanding intra cluster and inter cluster distances
* got to know different ways to caluclate the distances like chebyshev distance, Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance


Project: SVM breast cancer prediction
Goal: Understand SVM algorithm and able to implement it effectively on breast cancer prediction data.
my take aways:
* got to undertand what is a support line and how it distinguishes the data
* got to it can be used for continuous and non continuous target variable
* understood types of kernel linear, polynomial and rbf kernels
* got to know how to project fatures to higher dimensions
* started my Hyper parameter tuning implementation
* got to undertand PCA can be used for cluster visualization also along side its dimensionality reduction purpose


Project: Telecom Churn Rate prediction
Goal: To do an end to end ML project including all my learnings and provide best possible solutionns to handle churn rate in telecom industry.
my take awyas:
* understanding the Data and making inferences out of it before starting EDA to help me perform EDA more effeciently
* got to learn a technique to split the numerical and categorical features and work on them seperately and then assemble them together, this way handling them is bit easier
* got to know how to handle outliers by capping and flooring method
* learned a new feature selection skill by performing binning technique and eliminating features which are in lowest percentile bin
* applied multiple models like Linear Regression, DT and Random forest
* got a better understanding of confusion matrix and its metrics F1_Score Precession and Recall
* got a better understanding of when to go with precession and when to go with Recall
* learnt to bin the predicted values so that a clear idea can be given to the business
